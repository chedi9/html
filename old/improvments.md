# WeBuy Project Vision & Master TODO

---

## Inclusive Marketplace Vision

WeBuy is a multi-vendor marketplace with a special mission: **to empower and prioritize disabled people**. The platform will feature:
- **Disabled sellers**: Their stories and products will be added manually by the admin. Their products and stores are always given priority and highlighted throughout the site. This is the main purpose of the platform.
- **Normal sellers**: Any user can register as a seller and manage their own store, products, and analytics. They have full access to the seller dashboard and store features.

**Note:** The marketplace is open to all, but disabled people and their stories are always featured and prioritized in search, promotions, and homepage sections.

### 9A. Centralized Payment Flow & Seller Payouts (Planned)
- [ ] **Implement Centralized Payment Flow**
  - [ ] All customer payments go to platform account (WeBuy)
  - [ ] Deduct platform commission and delivery fees automatically
  - [ ] Hold funds until delivery is confirmed or return window expires
  - [ ] Payout to sellers on a clear schedule (e.g., weekly, after delivery confirmation)
  - [ ] Handle all refunds, disputes, and buyer protection from platform account
- [ ] **Automate Seller Payout Calculations**
  - [ ] Build a "seller balance" system to track all sales, commissions, refunds, and payouts
  - [ ] Provide sellers with a dashboard to view pending/paid earnings and payout history
  - [ ] Transparent reporting: show all fees, commissions, and payout status
- [ ] **Clear Payout Schedule**
  - [ ] Define and communicate payout schedule (e.g., weekly, monthly)
  - [ ] Set rules for when funds are released (e.g., after delivery confirmation or return window)
- [ ] **Legal & Tax Compliance**
  - [ ] Ensure compliance with local laws for holding and transferring funds
  - [ ] Collect and manage seller tax information as required
- [ ] **Buyer Protection**
  - [ ] Hold funds until delivery is confirmed, then release to sellers
  - [ ] Implement clear refund and dispute resolution process
- [ ] **Scalability & Future-Proofing**
  - [ ] Design system to allow for future split payments if local gateways support it
  - [ ] Modularize payout logic for easy adaptation

### 9B. Centralized Payment Flow Implementation Notes (For Next Session)

**Database Tables to Add:**
- `seller_balances`: Tracks each seller's available and pending balances.
- `payouts`: Records each payout to a seller (amount, method, status, reference, etc.).
- `payout_items`: Links payouts to specific orders/items, with commission and fee breakdowns.

**Order Processing Logic:**
- On order payment:
  - Calculate platform commission and delivery fees per order item.
  - Allocate net amount to each seller's `pending_balance`.
  - Log all calculations for audit (optionally in an `order_settlements` table).

**Payout Logic:**
- On payout schedule (weekly/monthly/manual):
  - Move eligible funds from `pending_balance` to `current_balance` after delivery/return window.
  - Create a `payout` record for each seller.
  - Mark included orders/items as paid out.
  - Support both manual and future automated payout execution.

**Refunds & Disputes:**
- If refund before payout: Deduct from seller's `pending_balance`.
- If after payout: Deduct from next payout or flag for manual resolution.

**Seller Dashboard Enhancements:**
- Show pending, available, and paid balances.
- List payout history and order breakdowns (gross, commission, delivery fee, net).

**Admin Panel Enhancements:**
- Schedule, review, and execute payouts.
- View payout and commission reports.
- Manage refund/dispute adjustments.

**Security & Audit Best Practices:**
- Log all balance changes and payouts (who, when, what).
- Restrict payout actions to authorized admins (with 2FA if possible).
- Store all payout and commission calculations for audit.
- Never store sensitive payment data in logs or additional_data fields.

**Compliance:**
- Collect and store seller tax info if required.
- Generate downloadable payout and commission reports for sellers and admin.

**Scalability:**
- Modularize commission and fee calculation logic for easy updates.
- Design payout logic to support future split payments if needed.

## Homepage Performance Optimization (TODO)
- Compress and resize all product images (use thumbnails for product cards)
- Implement lazy loading for all product images
- Set width and height attributes on all images to prevent layout shifts
- Paginate or virtualize product lists to avoid loading all products at once
- Audit and optimize large CSS/JS files if needed
- Goal: Reduce homepage size from 20MB to <2MB and eliminate scroll flicker
