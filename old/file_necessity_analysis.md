## üéØ RECOMMENDED APPROACH

### Conservative Cleanup (Recommended):
1. **Keep all client files** - They might be used by the client system
2. **Keep all root functionality files** - They might be used by the main website
3. **Delete only development/test files** - These are clearly not needed
4. **Archive documentation files** - Keep them for reference
5. **Optimize large files** - Compress images and CSS

### Files to Definitely Keep:
- All files in the "CRITICAL FILES" section
- All client files (they might be used)
- All root functionality files (they might be used)

### Files Safe to Delete:
- Development/test files
- Documentation files (archive instead of delete)
- Large files (optimize instead of delete)

## üîß MODIFIED CLEANUP SCRIPT

I should create a more conservative cleanup script that:
1. Only deletes clearly unnecessary development files
2. Archives documentation instead of deleting
3. Keeps all potentially functional files
4. Provides warnings before deleting anything important
